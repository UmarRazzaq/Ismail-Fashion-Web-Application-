                                    <img src="Images/logo.png" alt="">A fashion magazine labelled Ismail Fashion as the ‘HOF Chanel’ of Pakistan - indeed the innovation and transformation triggered by Ismail’s entry into the fashion industry justifies the comparison. With a design philosophy rooted in constant change, improvement and originality, the designer has already become a force to be reckoned with. One of the brightest fashion stars of the industry, she remains committed to bringing the very best to her customers without fail. She says, “I have been given tremendous love by everybody but my vision goes far beyond that. I regard myself as an entrepreneur as someone who’s artistic ability can be portrayed in everything that I do. Fashion is a medium that can speak volumes, bridge the gap between cultures, allows human expression like nothing else can. I am lucky enough to be in love with my work, and I intend to use that privilege to the fullest”. The designer admits that amongst all of her muses, her family remains the most important.</p>
                                <p>He had a clear idea of what he wanted from his brand. He wanted to challenge the status quo and bring energy and vitality to the almost non-existent designer retail market. And that is exactly what she did.</p>
